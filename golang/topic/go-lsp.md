Go language server

A language server *should* be a core part of each language, built and managed by the core language team. Tooling is so important to the developer experience for any language, and a language server is one of the most important kinds of tooling there is (because the user interacts with it on virtually every keystroke in their editor). So, we're very happy that there will be a Go language server that is owned by the Go team!
